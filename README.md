## Day2: 28th Nov
XGBoost [Link1](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/09/an-end-to-end-guide-to-understand-the-math-behind-xgboost/) [Link2](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-xgboost-applied-machine-learning/) [How to use XGBoost with Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-first-xgboost-model-python-scikit-learn/)

 ## Day3: 30th Nov
 Pytorch Udacity Introduction Lesson 2
(Videos 1 to 25 complete)

## Day4: 1st Dec
Study about [Accuracy Paradox](https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-paradox-897a69e2dd9b)

## Day5: 2nd Dec
Classification Algorithms study: [KNN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/), [SVC](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/), [K-medoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA0FBZE-948)

## Day6: 4th Dec
Studied About Apriori Algorithm Association rule, How is it different from collaborative filtering?
Studied about example of market basket analysis.

[Apriori Introduction](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/machine-learning/beginners-tutorial-apriori-algorithm-data-mining-r-implementation/) [Apriori vs Collaborative filtering](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/256012/item-item-collaborative-filtering-vs-market-basket-analysis)

## Day7: 5th Dec
Studied about [Spectral Clustering](https://towardsdatascience.com/spectral-clustering-for-beginners-d08b7d25b4d8)

## Day8: 6th Dec
Studying Natural Language Processing: CFG, CNF, CYK
CYK tells whether a given sentence can be generated from a given Content free grammer given.

Chomsky Normal Form is conversion from CFG to CNF. In CNF we have productions of form.
A-> BC
or A->epsilon

## Day9: 10th Dec
Cluster Algorithm KMeans, Heirarchical Clustering
